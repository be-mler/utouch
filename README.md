#utouch

My U-Touch implementation used in my AICP builds for ZUK Z2 Pro

1) Checkout at your android root folder

2) Install rcs

3) run ./merge_utouch.sh from this folder


WARNING - dont use copy_changed.sh! This replaces all the files in this utouch folder with the ones located at your android tree! This is only a script used by me that I dont have to copy all files by hand for a new commit.
